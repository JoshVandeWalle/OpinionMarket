### Problem and Solution  
The moniker OpinionMarket captures the concept of a marketplace of ideas making it the perfect name for an application all about sharing information and thoughts. The application is a web platform for social news and community-driven discussion that will facilitate discourse between individuals based on common interests. OpinionMarket will allow users to join communities of their choice, post content in those communities, comment on content posted by others, upvote or downvote any post or comment, and send direct messages. These features will support the creation of a vast ecosystem of meaningful discussions.  
  
The platform is designed to be easy for anyone to use and helpful for everyone. Whatever a user is interested in, be it a hobby, professional skill, or theoretical physics, they can find or start an online community dedicated to it. Community rules establish user-enforced behavioral regulations that keep communities focused on their topic. Customization features make communities unique, give them character, and allow them to stand out. The wealth of features they provide make OpinionMarket communities an excellent place to look for help, show off accomplishments, or find discussion of just about anything. The application presents an intuitive and friendly user interface that makes it easy to dive-in and start browsing content-rich communities.
