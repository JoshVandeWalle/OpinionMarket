OpinionMarket was ambitious in its archiectural, technical, and functional scope. The lists below shows the project risks and challenges that were overcome.

### Risks
- I had never used a microservice architecture before
- I had never used Spring Boot before
- I had never used MongoDB before
- I had never used React before
- I had never used Redux before
- I had never used Material-UI before
- I had never used Docker before
- I had never used AWS before
- I had never used OAuth2 before
- I had never used Maven before
- I had never done automated testing before

# Challenges
- Maintaining data consistancy with microservices and the Database-per-Service pattern
- Service orchestration
- Service Discovery
- Implementing OAuth2
- Working with files and persiting them

### How the Risks were Mitigated
I built several proof of concept application to gain familiarity with microservices, Spring Boot, MongoDB, React, Redux, Material-UI, Docker, AWS EC2, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, OAuth2, and Maven. I identified websites that provide useful information on technologies and architecture styles including but not limited to DZone, Microservices.io, Medium, YouTube, and TutorialsPoint. Risk mitigation was done during before the design phase of the project to remove
