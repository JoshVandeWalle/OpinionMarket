OpinionMarket was ambitious in its architectural, technical, and functional scope. The lists below outline the risks and challenges that were overcome.

### Risks
- I had never used a microservice architecture before
- I had never used Spring Boot before
- I had never used MongoDB before
- I had never used React before
- I had never used Redux before
- I had never used Material-UI before
- I had never used Docker before
- I had never used AWS before
- I had never used Maven before
- I had never done automated testing before

### Challenges
- Maintaining data consistency with microservices and the Database-per-Service pattern
- Service orchestration
- Service Discovery
- Working with files and persisting them
- Automating testing and deployment

### How the Risks were Mitigated
I built several proof-of-concept applications to gain familiarity with microservices, Spring Boot, MongoDB, React, Redux, Material-UI, Docker, AWS EC2, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, OAuth2, and Maven. I identified websites that provide useful information on technologies and architecture styles including but not limited to DZone, Microservices.io, Medium, YouTube, and TutorialsPoint. Risks were identified at the outset of the project to maximize the time that could be spent on mitigating them. Risk mitigation was done before the design phase of the project to remove uncertainty  about the technologies before designing the application.

### How the Challenges were Overcome
I used many of the same resources that I had previously used to familiarize myself with the new technologies and architecture patterns to help me overcome implementation challenges. Useful resources included official documentation, DZone, Medium, StackOverflow, Github Issues, and more. In every implementation decision I strove to follow industry best practices rather than blindly adopting the most expedient solutions.
